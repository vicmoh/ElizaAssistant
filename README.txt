Program Description
####################
    A program that uses a Binary Search Tree to provide answers
    to user provided questions. This program will be similar in
    concept to the early AI and natural language processing program
    called ‘Eliza’. Eliza provided basic communication (often nonsensical)
    to directly asked questions. The concept and technology of ‘Eliza’
    have been replaced with ‘Siri’, ‘Alexa’, “Echo”, and ‘Google Home’ but
    the concept of an automated personalized assistant certainly remains

How to run the program

    1) go to the directory on the program
    2) type: "make" to install the program
